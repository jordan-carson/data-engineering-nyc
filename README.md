### NYC Open Data

The source data for the assignment is the [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crash table](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95), or MVCC, provided by the **NYC OpenData** database. This table contains details on crash events from all NYC Boroughs, where each row represents a unique crash event.

The information from the MVCC originates from [Police Reports (MV-104AN)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf) filled in by the NYPD. According to the data description, "police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage". Additionally, this data is preliminary and subject to modifications when the forms are amended based on revised crash details. For the most accurate information, which is updated weekly and referred to as the [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page) and updated monthly - [Vision Zero View](https://vzv.nyc/).
